        abstract: 'Over 35% of Americans belong to racial minority groups. Pernicious, ubiquitous experiences with everday racism - both overt and subtle, profoundly impact physical, mental, and emotional well-being. While social support is one of the better documented coping strategies, people of color remain rightfully mistrustful and hesistant to utilize online social networks. In this work, I investigate how people of color use social technology to cope with the aftermath of interpersonal racism. I identify the current challenges in using social technology, and use participatory design approaches to examine speculative future technology design.',

        abstract: 'We explore how digital and non-digital games express diversity through characters, understood as representations of marginalized groups to which the player may or may not belong. We identify a range of techniques using visual design, abstract character representation, delineation of game setting and roles, conversation design, and the design of rules and systems. We illustrate these techniques with exemplar games identified through consultation with experts. This analysis yields four key recommendations for designing diversity across a range of game platforms: match diversity affordances to player needs; draw strengths from both the digital and non-digital realms; design for conversation; and consider player diversity. We conclude by proposing diversity as an end-to-end process in both game research and design.',

        title: 'Critical Race Theory for HCI',
        abstract: 'The human-computer interaction community has made some efforts toward racial diversity, but the outcomes remain meager. We introduce critical race theory and adapt it for HCI to lay a theoretical basis for race-conscious efforts, both in research and within our community. Building on the theory\'s original tenets, we argue that racism is pervasive in everyday socio-technical systems; that the HCI community is prone to "interest convergence", where concessions to inclusion require benefits to those in power; and that the neoliberal underpinnings of the technology industry itself propagate racism. Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deep-seated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI. The implications: all HCI research must be attuned to issues of race; participation of underrepresented minorities must be sought in all of our activities; and as a community, we cannot become comfortable while racial disparities exist.',
