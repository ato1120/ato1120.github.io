        title: 'Coping After Racist Experiences (CARE)',
        abstract: 'Over 35% of Americans belong to racial minority groups. Pernicious, ubiquitous experiences with everday racism - both overt and subtle, profoundly impact physical, mental, and emotional well-being. While social support is one of the better documented coping strategies, people of color remain rightfully mistrustful and hesistant to utilize online social networks. In this work, I investigate how people of color use social technology to cope with the aftermath of interpersonal racism. I identify the current challenges in using social technology, and use participatory design approaches to examine speculative future technology design.',
