                    <p><i>"Empowering Uncertainty Resolution for Marginalized Populations through Social Technologies"</i></p>
                    <p>My thesis focuses on how marginalization can harmfully amplify the negative impact of uncertainty. I focused on two contexts of marginalization: 1) STEM learning environments for female and/or students of color and 2) social coping with interpersonal racism for adults.</p>
